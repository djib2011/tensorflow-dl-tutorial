# Deep Learning with TensorFlow

An in-depth tutorial on the most popular framework for Neural Networks in python.

> Note: This tutorial has stopped being supported since November 2020 and I currently have no plans on revisiting it. A more updated TensorFlow tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/djib2011/tensorflow-training); this has a slightly different scope and doesn't go into so much depth.
